<h2 id="quick-start">🚀 Quick Start</h2>

#### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

1. **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
2. **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** configured (for GPU acceleration)

#### ⚙️ Installation Steps

##### 1. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/liweiphys/layra.git
cd layra

# Edit configuration file (modify server IP/parameters as needed)
vim .env

# Key configuration options include:
# - SERVER_IP (server IP)
# - MODEL_BASE_URL (model download source)
```

##### 2. Build and Start Service

```bash
# Initial startup will download ~15GB model weights (be patient)
docker compose up -d --build

# Monitor logs in real-time (replace <container_name> with actual name)
docker compose logs -f <container_name>
```

> **Note**: If you encounter issues with `docker compose`, try using `docker-compose` (with the dash) instead. Also, ensure that you're using Docker Compose v2, as older versions may not support all features. You can check your version with `docker compose version` or `docker-compose version`.

#### 🎉 Enjoy Your Deployment!

Now that everything is running smoothly, happy building with Layra! 🚀✨

<h2 id="why-layra">❓ Why LAYRA?</h2>

### 🚀 Beyond RAG: The Power of Visual-First Workflows

While LAYRA's **Visual RAG Engine** revolutionizes document understanding, its true power lies in the **Agent Workflow Engine** - a visual-native platform for building complex AI agents that see, reason, and act. Unlike traditional RAG/Workflow systems limited to retrieval, LAYRA enables full-stack automation through:

### ⚙️ Advanced Workflow Capabilities

- **🔄 Cyclic & Nested Structures**  
  Build recursive workflows with loop nesting, conditional branching, and custom Python logic - no structural limitations.

- **🐞 Node-Level Debugging**  
  Inspect variables, pause/resume execution, and modify state mid-workflow with visual breakpoint debugging.

- **👤 Human-in-the-Loop Integration**  
  Inject user approvals at critical nodes for collaborative AI-human decision making.

- **🧠 Chat Memory & MCP Integration**  
  Maintain context across nodes with chat memory and access live information via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

- **🐍 Full Python Execution**  
  Run arbitrary Python code with `pip` installs, HTTP requests, and custom libraries in sandboxed environments.

- **🎭 Multimodal I/O Orchestration**  
  Process and generate hybrid text/image outputs across workflow stages.

### 🔍 Visual RAG: The Seeing Engine

Traditional RAG systems fail because they:

- ❌ **Lose layout fidelity** (columns, tables, hierarchy collapse)
- ❌ **Struggle with non-text visuals** (charts, diagrams, figures)
- ❌ **Break semantic continuity** due to poor OCR segmentation

**LAYRA changes this with pure visual embeddings:**

> 🔍 It sees each page as a whole - just like a human reader - preserving:
>
> - ✅ Layout structure (headers, lists, sections)
> - ✅ Tabular integrity (rows, columns, merged cells)
> - ✅ Embedded visuals (plots, graphs, stamps, handwriting)
> - ✅ Multi-modal consistency between layout and content

**Together, these engines form the first complete visual-native agent platform - where AI doesn't just retrieve information, but executes complex vision-driven workflows end-to-end.**

### 👁️ Visual RAG Engine: Beyond Text, Beyond OCR

> **Forget tokenization. Forget layout loss.**  
> With pure visual embeddings, LAYRA understands documents like a human — page by page, structure and all.

**LAYRA** uses next-generation Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology powered by **pure visual embeddings**. It treats documents not as sequences of tokens but as visually structured artifacts — preserving layout, semantics, and graphical elements like tables, figures, and charts.

<h2 id="system-architecture">🧠 System Architecture</h2>

LAYRA’s pipeline is designed for **async-first**, **visual-native**, and **scalable document retrieval and generation**.

### 🔍 Query Flow

The query goes through embedding → vector retrieval → anser generation:

![Query Architecture](./assets/query.png)

### 📤 Upload & Indexing Flow

PDFs are parsed into images and embedded visually via ColQwen2.5, with metadata and files stored in appropriate databases:

![Upload Architecture](./assets/upload.png)

### 📤 Execute Workflow (Chatflow)

The workflow execution follows an **event-driven**, **stateful debugging** pattern with granular control:

#### 🔄 Execution Flow

1. **Trigger & Debug Control**

   - Web UI submits workflow with **configurable breakpoints** for real-time inspection
   - Backend validates workflow DAG before executing codes

2. **Asynchronous Orchestration**

   - Kafka checks **predefined breakpoints** and triggers pause notifications
   - Scanner performs **AST-based code analysis** with vulnerability detection

3. **Secure Execution**

   - Sandbox spins up ephemeral containers with file system isolation
   - Runtime state snapshots persisted to _Redis/MongoDB_ for recovery

4. **Observability**
   - Execution metrics streamed via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Users inject test inputs/resume execution through debug consoles

<h2 id="deployment">⚙️ Deployment</h2>

#### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

1. **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
2. **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** configured (for GPU acceleration)

#### ⚙️ Installation Steps

##### 1. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/liweiphys/layra.git
cd layra

# Edit configuration file (modify server IP/parameters as needed)
vim .env

# Key configuration options include:
# - SERVER_IP (public server IP)
# - MODEL_BASE_URL (model download source)
```

##### 2. Build and Start Service

```bash
# Initial startup will download ~15GB model weights (be patient)
docker compose up -d --build

# Monitor logs in real-time (replace <container_name> with actual name)
docker compose logs -f <container_name>
```

> **Note**: If you encounter issues with `docker compose`, try using `docker-compose` (with the dash) instead. Also, ensure that you're using Docker Compose v2, as older versions may not support all features. You can check your version with `docker compose version` or `docker-compose version`.

#### 🛠️ Service Management Commands

```bash
# Stop services (preserves data and configurations)
docker compose down

# Full cleanup (deletes databases, model weights and persistent data)
docker compose down -v

# Restart services
docker compose start
```

#### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Initial model download** may take significant time (~15GB). Monitor progress:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f model-weights-init
   ```

2. **Verify NVIDIA toolkit** installation:

   ```bash
   nvidia-container-toolkit --version
   ```

3. **For network issues**:
   - Manually download model weights
   - Copy to Docker volume: （typically at） `/var/lib/docker/volumes/layra_model_weights/_data/`
   - Create empty `complete.layra` file in both:
     - **`colqwen2.5-base`** folder
     - **`colqwen2.5-v0.2`** folder
   - 🚨 **Critical**: Verify downloaded weights integrity!

#### 🔑 Key Details

- `docker compose down` **`-v` flag warning**: Permanently deletes all databases and models
- **After modifying `.env`**: Rebuild with `docker compose up --build`
- **GPU requirements**:
  - Latest NVIDIA drivers
  - Working `nvidia-container-toolkit`
- **Monitoring tools**:

  ```bash
  # Container status
  docker compose ps -a

  # Resource usage
  docker stats
  ```

> 🧪 **Technical Note**: All components run exclusively via Docker containers.
